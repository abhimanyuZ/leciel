A Web-Platform for annual cultural festival Leciel'18 of NIT Pudicherry India

# Demo:

# Details:
  I worked on this website in 2018. It has a very smooth UI which uses multiple JS frameworks like Jquery, Bootstrap etc.<br>
  For backend PHP 7.2 is used along with MongoDB server. MySQLi is used to communicate with server.<br>
  A secure payment portal (Paytm) is also integrated with this, which makes registration and payment for various events in the fest pretty easy 
  (for security purposes payment process is disabled now).<br>
  To uniquely identify users, QR Codes are being used. <br>
  
  This project can serve as a template. I can be used to create a web platform for any similar events/festivals.
  Users can change it as per their event requirements.
